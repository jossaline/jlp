            <p>
                If you or someone else is in danger, do not wait: call the police for help on 000. Their job is to ensure your safety and to investigate if a crime has been committed. Even if it is not a crime, the police and other services can help protect you.
                <br><br>
                You can contact the police at any time to report abuse that has happened to you, even if it happened months or years ago. If you want the police to charge the person with a crime, you will need to make a ‘statement’ that describes what happened. The police will type what you told them, investigate it and decide whether there is enough evidence to charge the person with a criminal offence.

            <h1 class="Intervention order"></h1>
            <p>
              An intervention order is intended to protect you from experiencing violence from another person. It includes conditions that can prevent a person from:
              <ul>
                <li>Committing family violence against you (including emotional, financial, physical, psychological or sexual abuse)</li>
                <li>Damaging or threatening to damage your property</li>
                <li>Contacting you (including by text or email)</li>
                <li>Coming within 200m of your school, home or work, or come within 5m of you</li>
                <li>Get anyone else to do any of those things</li>
              <br>
              You can apply for an intervention order to protect you here:
              <a href="https://www.mcv.vic.gov.au/form-finder/application-family-violence-intervention-order-fvio1">https://www.mcv.vic.gov.au/form-finder/application-family-violence-intervention-order-fvio1</a>. It is always a good idea to get legal advice before applying.
              <br><br>
              If an intervention order is broken, the police can arrest them and charge them with a criminal offence. This could result in a criminal record and penalties such as jail time or fines. These orders are enforceable anywhere in Australia. In an emergency, please call 000.
              <br><br>
              
              <h1 class="title is-5">Reporting a breach of an IVO</h1>
              Keep a diary of every breach, writing down dates, times and exactly what happened and what was said. Further, no breach of an IVO condition is too small for police to act on a report that the IVO conditions have been broken. When you report a breach, the police will take a signed statement, interview the respondent and any witnesses before
              deciding whether to make any charges.
