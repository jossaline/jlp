          <p>
            “Family violence” is a term used to describe any violent, threatening, coercive or controlling behaviour that occurs between people who share or have shared a family or intimate relationship. 
            <br><br>

            Family violence is not limited to physical violence but includes:
            <ul>
              <li>direct or indirect threats</li> 
              <li>sexual assault</li>
              <li>emotional and psychological torment</li>
              <li>economic control</li>
              <li>damage to property</li>
              <li>social isolation</li>
              <li>any behaviour which causes a person to live in fear</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            A person can still suffer from family violence even if the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim no longer exists.
            <br><br>
            Family violence can occur in a range of scenarios, such as between elderly adults and their children, or between siblings. Most commonly however, family violence is perpetrated by current or previous male partners against female partners.
            <br><br>
            Family violence has very serious impacts on both individual sufferers and on society:

            <ul>
              <li>It is the leading contributor to preventable death, disability and illness in Victorian women aged 15 to 44</li>
              <li>It results in at least one woman being admitted to hospital every three hours</li> 
              <li> One in five women had experienced violence from a current or previous partner since the age of 15</li>
              <li>In 2015 intimate partner violence contributed 41% of homicide & violence burden, 19% each of suicide & self-inflicted injuries and depressive disorders burden and 18% of early pregnancy loss burden</li>
            </ul>
      
            <br>
            The psychological and social effects of family violence can include:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Feelings of self-blame and shame</li>
              <li>Loss of self-esteem</li>
              <li>Isolation from others</li>
              <li>Depression</li>
              <li>Anxiety</li>
              <li>Loss of employment opportunities</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The use of violence against a family member or intimate partner is a choice: an abuser chooses to use coercive or violent behaviour to have power and control over somebody else, even if they try to make excuses for themselves and their behaviour.
            <br><br>
            While the use of family violence is a choice, there are broader factors in our society that enable family violence to exist. Gender inequity - the unequal treatment of men and women - racism, classism and a range of other factors all contribute to the problem.
            <br><br>
            Only by raising awareness of family violence, and holding perpetrators accountable, can we hope to eradicate this social problem.

          <h1 class="title is-3">What does the law say?</h1>
          <p>
            Under the Victorian government Family Violence Protection Act 2008, family violence is defined as:
            (a) behaviour by a person towards a family member of that person if that behaviour
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Is physically or sexually abusive or</li>
              <li>Is emotionally or psychologically abusive or</li>
              <li>Is economically abusive or</li>
              <li>Is threatening or</li>
              <li>Is coercive or</li>
              <li>In any other way controls or dominates the family member and causes that family member to feel fear for the safety or wellbeing of that family member or another person</li>
            </ul>
            
            Or
            <br>
            (b) behaviour by a person that causes a child to hear or witness, or otherwise be exposed to the effects of, behaviour referred to in paragraph (a).</li>
            <br>
            The Victorian government recognises that:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Family violence violates human rights</li>
              <li>Family violence is not acceptable in any community or culture</li>
              <li>Family violence can seriously affect the emotional, physical and psychological wellbeing of children</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          </p>
          <h1 class="title is-3">Definitions</h1>
          <p>
            Intimate partner abuse: violent behaviour used by a current or former spouse or partner against the other spouse or partner.
            <br><br>
            Dating abuse: violent behaviour used by a casual partner against the other partner.
            <br><br>
            Child abuse: violent behaviour or mistreatment towards a child or young person by a parent or caregiver. Under Victorian law, exposing a child to any form of family violence is also a reportable child abuse offence – so if a person is abusive towards their spouse in front of their child or children, child abuse has occurred.
            <br><br>
            Elder abuse: violent behaviour or mistreatment towards an older person by a partner or family member, often including financial abuse, controlling behaviours and/or negligence.
            <br><br>
            Parental abuse: violent behaviour towards a parent by an adolescent child or dependant.
